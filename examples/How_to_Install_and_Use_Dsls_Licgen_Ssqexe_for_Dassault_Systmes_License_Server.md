## Step 1: Download and Install DSLS
 
Before you can use Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe, you need to have DSLS installed on your computer. DSLS is a software that manages the license keys for Dassault SystÃ¨mes products. You can download DSLS from the [Software License Keys](https://www.3ds.com/terms/software-keys/) page on the Dassault SystÃ¨mes website[^1^]. Follow the instructions on the page to install DSLS on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Identify the Computer ID or Target ID of Your Computer
 
After installing DSLS, you need to identify the computer ID or target ID of your computer. This is a unique identifier that is required to generate license keys for your computer. To identify your computer ID or target ID, you need to use the DSLS target ID Generator tool. You can download this tool from the same page where you downloaded DSLS[^1^]. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your computer and run this command:
 `DSLicTarget.exe ât` 
This will display your computer ID or target ID on the screen. Copy this value and save it somewhere.
 
## Step 3: Run Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe and Generate License Keys
 
Now you are ready to use Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe to generate license keys for your computer. You can download Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe from various sources on the internet, but be careful as some of them may contain viruses or malware. Make sure you scan the file with an antivirus program before running it.
 
Once you have downloaded Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe, run it as an administrator. You will see a window like this:

In the "Target ID" field, paste the computer ID or target ID that you copied in step 2. In the "Product" field, select the Dassault SystÃ¨mes product that you want to activate. In the "Version" field, select the version of the product that you have installed. In the "Expiration Date" field, enter a date in the future when you want your license key to expire. You can also check or uncheck some options below according to your preferences.
 
When you are done, click on "Generate License". This will create a license key file with a .LIC extension in the same folder where Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe is located. You can rename this file if you want.
 
## Step 4: Enroll License Key File in DSLS
 
The final step is to enroll the license key file that you generated in step 3 in DSLS. This will activate your Dassault SystÃ¨mes product on your computer. To enroll the license key file in DSLS, follow these steps:
 
1. Open DSLS as an administrator.
2. Type in the hostname of your computer in the "License Server name" field and click on "Connect".
