- Get the right trumpet. Your first trumpet should be in the key of Bb (B flat) since thatâs a standard trumpet, the key that most beginner trumpet sheet music is written in. You should also look for a trumpet that is comfortable to hold, easy to play, and has good sound quality. You can ask your teacher or a music store staff for advice on choosing a suitable trumpet for your level and budget.
- Practice regularly. The best way to improve your trumpet skills is to practice consistently and frequently. You should aim to practice at least 15 minutes every day, or more if possible. You can use Standard of Excellence Book 1 as a guide for your practice sessions, or follow a practice routine that covers warm-ups, technical exercises, scales, songs, and sight-reading. You should also practice with a metronome and a tuner to improve your rhythm and intonation.
- Listen to other trumpet players. Listening to other trumpet players can inspire you and help you develop your musical ear. You can listen to recordings of famous trumpet players from different genres and styles, such as Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Wynton Marsalis, Alison Balsom, and Arturo Sandoval. You can also watch videos of trumpet players on YouTube or attend live concerts if possible. Try to imitate their tone, phrasing, articulation, and expression.
- Take care of your trumpet. Your trumpet is a delicate instrument that needs proper care and maintenance. You should clean your trumpet regularly by wiping it with a soft cloth, oiling the valves, greasing the slides, and washing the mouthpiece. You should also store your trumpet in a case when not in use and avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures or humidity. If your trumpet needs repair or adjustment, you should take it to a professional technician.
- Have fun. Playing trumpet should be an enjoyable and rewarding experience for you. You should play music that you like and that challenges you. You should also have fun experimenting with different sounds and effects on your trumpet, such as vibrato, glissando, mute, growl, flutter tongue, and half-valve. You can also join a band or an ensemble and play with other musicians. Playing trumpet can enrich your life and bring joy to others.
