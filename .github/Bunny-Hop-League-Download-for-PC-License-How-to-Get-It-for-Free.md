## Bunny Hop League Review - What Do Players Think?
 
Bunny Hop League has received mostly positive reviews from players who have tried it on Steam. Many of them praised the game's smooth gameplay, responsive controls, and addictive challenge. They also enjoyed the variety of levels, the online leaderboards, and the custom map editor. Some of the common compliments from players are:

- "This game is amazing. It's so satisfying to pull off a perfect run and beat your own time. The levels are well-designed and fun to explore. The graphics are simple but nice. The music is catchy and fits the mood. The game is easy to learn but hard to master."
- "If you like speedrunning, platforming, or just want to improve your movement skills in FPS games, this game is for you. It's very rewarding to see yourself improve and climb the ranks. The game is also very polished and bug-free. The developer is active and listens to feedback."
- "This game is a blast. It's like a mix of Quake, Mirror's Edge, and Super Meat Boy. The game is fast-paced and challenging, but also relaxing and fun. The game has a lot of content and replay value. The online mode is great for competing with friends or strangers."

However, not everyone was happy with Bunny Hop League. Some players criticized the game's lack of tutorials, difficulty curve, and optimization issues. They also felt that the game was too repetitive, boring, or frustrating. Some of the common complaints from players are:

- "This game is too hard. There is no tutorial or explanation of how to bunny hop or use the grappling hook. The levels are too long and unforgiving. The checkpoints are too far apart. The game is not fun, it's just frustrating."
- "This game is too easy. There is no challenge or skill involved. You just hold down a button and jump around. The levels are too short and simple. The game is not rewarding, it's just boring."
- "This game is poorly optimized. It runs poorly on my PC even on low settings. It crashes frequently or freezes randomly. The game is not stable, it's just buggy."

Overall, Bunny Hop League seems to be a game that appeals to a niche audience of hardcore platformer fans who enjoy testing their skills and reflexes in a fast-paced and challenging environment. If you are one of them, you might want to give it a try and see for yourself if it lives up to your expectations.
