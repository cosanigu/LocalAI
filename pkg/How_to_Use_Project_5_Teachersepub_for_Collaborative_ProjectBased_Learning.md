## What is Project 5 Teacher's.epub?
 
Project 5 Teacher's.epub is an electronic book that contains a collection of ready-made PBL units for elementary school students. Each unit is based on a driving question that sparks students' curiosity and connects to real-world issues and contexts. The units cover various subjects and topics, such as science, math, social studies, language arts, art, and technology. The units also align with the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards.
 
Project 5 Teacher's.epub was created by a team of educators and researchers from the Media Lab Asia, a nonprofit organization that promotes innovation and social impact through technology. The project was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Ministry of Education of Singapore. The project aims to provide teachers with a flexible and user-friendly tool that can help them implement PBL in their classrooms.

Each unit also has links to online resources that can support the unit implementation.
